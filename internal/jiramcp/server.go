const instructions = `JIRA MCP Server — interact with JIRA Cloud via three tools:

- jira_read: Fetch issues by key, search by JQL, or list resources (projects, boards, sprints, sprint issues).
- jira_write: Create, update, delete, transition issues; add/edit comments; move issues to sprints. Supports batch (array of items). Always has dry_run option.
- jira_schema: Discover fields, transitions, field options — metadata needed to construct valid jira_write payloads.

Workflow tips:
1. Use jira_schema to discover available fields and transitions before writing.
2. Use jira_read with JQL for flexible queries.
3. All jira_write actions support dry_run=true to preview changes without applying them.
4. Descriptions and comments accept Markdown — they are auto-converted to Atlassian Document Format.`
